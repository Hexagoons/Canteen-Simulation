# Hanze project 1.4

## TL;DR
In the coming six weeks we will work on a canteen simulation. The final simulation is a text-based application where customers can choose items, stand in line and pay. All kinds of things such as paying with cash or pin and calculating turnover data are gradually discussed. The final part is aimed at learning how to work with more complex data structures and how data is stored.

Every week consists of a number of exercises. The first tasks are mainly aimed at refreshing Java knowledge. Subsequently, the writing of algorithms and program structure is discussed and finally working with data.

## Rules
* The deadline for handing in elaboration is always 6:00 pm on the Monday following the week to which the assignments belong. So, for example, you submit your elaboration from week 1 no later than Monday to week 2. The teacher will ask for a short demonstration and explanation about your elaboration.
* Every week the completed work is assessed as excellent, good, sufficient or insufficient (10, 8, 6, 4). The final grade will be an average of these assessments.
* If a week with unsatisfactory assessment is made the following week makes it possible to resit it.
* It is not a joke that you divide the assignments, but you are able to explain everything regardless of how it works. An excuse such as "I did not make that, so I cannot explain it" is therefore seen as not having made the assignment.
* Not present when discussing the same as not having made the statement.
* One grade will be give to the whole group, but the lecturer will deviate from this if there is a disproportionate division of work or the inability to explain an elaboration.
